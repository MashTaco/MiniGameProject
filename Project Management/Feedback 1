FEEDBACK FROM SUNDAR
Wanted a help button
Bad english
Make better sprites (blocks)
Make the “W” key a jump
Have different level layouts
Final verdict: 7.5/10


How we will use this feedback:
add a help button 
make the phrases in the game grammatically correct
redesign sprites (if not too complicated with time restraint for due date of project)
make "W" key jump so all action buttons are proximate to each other (wasd instead of asd space)
edit layouts

Game Ideas (Brainstorming)
Soccer- user plays a soccer game against another team along with simulated players on his/her own team  
Badminton- user plays sport of badminton against opponent (computer)
Story based- user makes decisions that determine which platform he/she lands on in game (choose your own adventure!)
Cards- were thinking of doing a card game but are not interested in making a unique game
Tennis- similar to badminton game concept
Bloons tower defense- cannot do this because a unique game has to be created 

Narrowing down options: 

soccer/badminton/tennis: we thought that there would not be much creative control seeing that the rules of these games are well-established already (would be difficult to come up with new twist)

cards- would be difficult to come up with unique game that does not have too many complicated rules (hard to make it fun and new)

bllons- as mentioned before, we cannot copy the game 

therefore we chose story based because we could choose whatever story "plots" qwe wanted to and could design whatever we wanted

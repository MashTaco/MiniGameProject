Algorithm (specific)
Display options on home screen using java swing 
User input action
If user clicks options, image of options including sound and instructions
	If they click sound, music will either play or mute (do opposite of what it is currently doing)
	If they click instructions, image with printed instructions will appear on screen
	If they click back, they will be sent to the main menu (home screen) again
If user clicks quit, program will stop running
If user clicks play, show slide with image and question with two options
	If user clicks option 1, send to platform 1
	Else go to option 2
		Play game, jump and run on platforms (using arrow keys to dictate direction of main sprite)
			If user falls through hole, restart round on that platform
			If user passes, ask them next question, again with two options 

--same idea, except with two brand new options 
(there will be a total of three “decisions” that can be made, meaning that user plays three of six rounds because they select one of two each time they complete a level

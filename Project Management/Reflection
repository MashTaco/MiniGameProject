This adventure platform game would be released because the final product was entertaining, efficient and achieved our main objective (objectie being to allow the user to choose their own adventure; we gave them 6 different options). 

The code was updated constantly in order to improve its quality. For instance, images were changed to be more aestetically pleasing, effieicency of code was changed (always making code more effective/efficient).  

Next steps : comment more of the code to explain the program more, if more time, add even more levels (platforms) to the code in order to give user even more options to play their own adventure. 

The program is user friendly, clear, neatly written. However, if possible, it could use a bit more commenting. In fact, that could be a source of improvement. 

Nothing significant was missing from our final product of the platform adventure game. 

Overall, the project is ready for the public.
